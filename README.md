Functionally Reduced And-Inverter Graph (FRAIG)
===
This program is an electronic design automation (EDA) tool that can reduce the size of logical circuits automatically. It can perform the following functions:

1.Parses the logical circuit description file in the AIGER format.

2.Uses hash to detect structurally equivalent signals in a circuit.

3.Performs Boolean logic simulations and identify functionally equivalent candidate pairs in the circuit as “functionally equivalent candidate (FEC) pair”.

4.Calls Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver to prove the functional equivalence.
